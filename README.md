# Rent A Space, [Akure]

## Mission
My goal for this is to build a solution to address three major problems, namely;
- the lengthy time clients spend house hunting.
- the significant stress associated with house hunting.
- the lack of a comprehensive database of real estate properties.

## Target Users
Generally speaking, we expect most of our clients to be people who are looking to either rent, buy, sell or invest a property. From the mission of this project its evident that of all our clients we'll be focusing on home renters and home owners.

## Approach 
To profer solutions to these problems, RASP is an app that lets users explore all available properties in their region. Armed with this, and a host of other requirements they deem fit, they can make a choice to rent, buy or invest in a property through a very seamless click-through procedure on our platform. This process might include booking an appointment to see the property, paying for the property online [long shot: take an immersive VR tour of the property], putting up a flag for requirements.
